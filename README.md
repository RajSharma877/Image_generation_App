# Image Generation App

Image Generation App is a web application that allows users to generate and view images based on text descriptions using OpenAI's DALL-E. Built with the MERN stack, ArtGen integrates OpenAI's API to provide creative and unique artwork generation.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **APIs:** OpenAI API, DALL-E
- **Styling:** CSS

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- OpenAI API Key

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image_Generation_App.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Imae_Generation_App
3. Set up the backend:
   i. Go to the server directory:
     cd server
   ii. Install dependencies:
       npm install
   iii. Create a .env file and add your OpenAI API key:
       OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   iv. Start the server:
       npm start
4. Set up the frontend:
     i. Go to the client directory:
         cd ../client

         npm start
5. Access the application:
   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

**Machine Learning Algorithms**
The project leverages OpenAI's DALL-E model to generate images based on textual descriptions provided by users. The API uses state-of-the-art deep learning models to create detailed and contextually relevant images.
